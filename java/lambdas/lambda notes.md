what are lambda's?
a lambda is a short anonymous function.  

why's it awesome?
basically allows for a paradigm shift from object oriented programming to functional programming, which as a C++ programmer I love.

pros:

cons:





good questions:
in c++, you can control if a lambda passes by value or reference with a simple star or amperstand, but in java, how do you know if you're passing by reference or value?  Can you change it?
